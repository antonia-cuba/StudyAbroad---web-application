#### Description:
   Hello world! Antonia here~

   My Final Project for CS50 consists of a website, StudyAbroad, which is designed to help students choose where to study abroad.

   For now, it consists of 5 countries, each having their own page where you can find information about culture, tuition fees, part-time job opportunities, language courses, top 5 universities and more about each country.

   There is also a reviews page, where people can rate and leave a review about the chosen country.

   For the website I used HTML, Python, CSS, Jinja, JavaScript, a database and a number of Bootstrap features.

   The database stores users' name, university, the country where they're studying, rating of that country and additional comments about theire experience.

   When creating the website, I found sorting the reviews by country the most challenging. This part took me the longest, as I tried in multiple ways. In the end, after much trial and error, I decided to create a page for each country-filter, where only reviews about that specific country appear.

   While working on this project, I feel like I have got a taste of what's like to work in the industry, having the chance to play and implement my own ideas. It was a very rewarding process, seeing the fruits of labor at the end.

## Possible improvments
    - Log in page for students who want to leave a review
    - Contact page where users can leave messages with questions about studying abroad
    - Q&A page with the most asked questions about studying abroad
