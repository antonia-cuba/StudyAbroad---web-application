   Hello world! Antonia here~

   My Final Project for CS50 consists of a website, StudyAbroad, which is designed to help students choose where to study abroad.

   For now, it consists of 5 countries, each having their own page where you can find information about culture, tuition fees, part-time job opportunities, language courses, top 5 universities and more about each country.

   There is also a reviews page, where people can rate and leave a review about the chosen country.

   For the website I used HTML, Python, CSS, Jinja, JavaScript, a database and a number of Bootstrap features.

   The database stores users' name, university, the country where they're studying, rating of that country and additional comments about theire experience. Please don't leave any field blank as the website won't let you submit a review with any blank field. This page also has a star rating feature. Once you hit the submit button, you are redirected to the page where you can see and filter all the reviews, including the one you've just added.

   Another feature of my website are the icons on the tab. Every country has its flag as icon and for the other pages is an ancient paper (this represents the idea of university the best :)).

   When displaying the reviews, I decided to lay them out in a table, so it is easy for the user to see all the information at once.

   *To return to homepage from every other page, click on the "StudyAbroad" icon in the bar.

   When creating the website, I found sorting the reviews by country the most challenging. This part took me the longest, as I tried in multiple ways. In the end, after much trial and error, I decided to create a page for each country-filter, where only reviews about that specific country appear.

   While working on this project, I feel like I have got a taste of what's like to work in the industry, having the chance to play and implement my own ideas. It was a very rewarding process, seeing the fruits of labor at the end.

   Possible improvments
    - Log in page for students who want to leave a review
    - Contact page where users can leave messages with questions about studying abroad
    - Q&A page with the most asked questions about studying abroad
    - Search bar

    This is all about my website, hope you enjoy playing around with it!
