#### Description:
   My final project consists of a website, StudyAbroad, which is designed to help students choose where to study abroad.
   
   For now, it consists of 5 countries, each having their own page where you can find information about culture, tuition fees, part-time job opportunities, language courses, top 5 universities and more about each country.
   
   There is also a reviews page, where people can rate and leave a review about the chosen country.
   
   When creating the website, I found sorting the reviews by country the most challenging. This part took me the longest, as I tried in multiple ways. In the end, after much trial and error, I decided to create a page for each country-filter, where only reviews about that specific country appear.
   
   For the website I used HTML, Python, CSS, Jinja, JavaScript, a database and a number of Bootstrap features.
